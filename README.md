## Important Privacy Notice for AsperNet Users

AsperNet is a free alternative DNS resolver designed to provide reliable and efficient service. However, please be aware of the following:

1. **IP Address Exposure**: AsperNet does not have a dedicated IP address for its DNS service. Instead, it downloads `records.json` from our repository and hosts the DNS on the device from which you access AsperNet. While this means that your DNS queries are processed locally, your IP address may still be visible to any external services you access.

2. **Separation of Services**: AsperNet fully guarantees the safety of services hosted under the Asper domain (e.g., `fediverse.asper.anet`, `git.asper.anet`). However, we do not have visibility into or control over the services you access through our DNS resolver, particularly those not belonging to Asper (e.g., `ann.anet`). Additionally, we do not guarantee the safety of any services when using third-party `records.json` files. This is because Asper's IP addresses can change, and we utilize FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) solutions for our services, making it easy for users to replicate everything.

3. **User Responsibility**: To enhance your privacy while using our service, we encourage you to consider using IP-hiding tools based on your needs. While we cannot endorse specific services, there are various options available that can help you protect your online identity.

By using AsperNet, you acknowledge that you understand your IP address may be exposed and that it is your responsibility to take any necessary measures to protect your privacy.

Thank you for choosing AsperNet!

# About AsperNet

AsperNet is an alternative internet solution that offers custom DNS, the .anet TLD, and the freedom of choice.

## What is 'anet' or 'AsperNet(work)'?

AsperNet is a project similar to I2P, providing users with unlimited freedom. What does this mean?

1. **Public IPs**: Both server and client IPs are public. If you are a web host, please use a VPS VPN to hide your IP. Regular users should also consider using a VPN. ***We do not provide any warranty regarding how any IPs will be used. Hiding them is solely your responsibility.***

2. **Free Domains**: Unlike the traditional internet, you can easily set up a domain in AsperNet. Please refer to the instructions below.

3. **Customizability and Flexibility**: This is a FOSS project licensed under GPLv3, allowing you to fork this repository and create your own network. This is why the project is ***highly optimized*** for various use cases.
