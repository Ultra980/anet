# Project is under structure.
please reach out to me if something doesnt work, undocumented or anything like this. oh also many things are referring to objects/files/folders which do not exist, thats a matter of time.

# anet
AsperNet is a (whatnot) alternative internet. It offers custom DNS, .anet TLD and freedom of choice.

# What is 'anet' or 'AsperNet(work)'?
anet is a project simmiliar to i2p, it offers it's users have unlimited freedom. What does this mean? 

1. Server IPs and Client's IPs all public. Please use a VPS VPN to hide your IP if you're a webhost, and use a usual VPN if you're user. ***I don't give any warranty about how any of IPs are going to be used. Hiding them is only Your job.***
2. Free domains - unlike usual internet, in anet you can easily setuo a domain. read the instructions below.
3. Customizability and flexibility - this is a FOSS project, licensed under GPLv3 so you can fork this repo, and make your own network, hence why is this project is ***so goddamn optimised*** for any cases.

# How to do X?
read docs.
