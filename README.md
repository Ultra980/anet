## Important Privacy Notice for AsperNet Users

AsperNet is a free DNS resolver designed to empower users with choice. However, please note the following:

1. **IP Address Exposure**: By using AsperNet, we do not guarantee anonymity while accessing third-party services. This means that any domain can potentially track your IP address without your consent. However, domains under the AsperNet umbrella (e.g., `git.asper.anet`) will NOT track your IP address whenever possible. In cases where IP logging cannot be disabled, we will only use this information in emergency situations, such as investigations involving prohibited or illegal content.

2. **Service Separation**: While services under the AsperNet domain (e.g., `git.asper.anet`) are secure, we cannot guarantee the safety of third-party services accessed through our DNS resolver. AsperNet supports third-party local `records.json`, allowing users to change our IP addresses to their own. As a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) project, our services can be easily replicated.

3. **User Responsibility**: We STRONGLY recommend using IP-hiding tools to protect your privacy. It is your responsibility to take necessary measures against IP tracking.

By using AsperNet, you acknowledge the potential risks associated with misuse of the tool.

Thank you for choosing AsperNet!
